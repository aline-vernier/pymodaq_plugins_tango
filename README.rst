Installation instructions
=========================

Instrument plugins for stuff on the tango bus
        * Anything on the tango bus can be viewed. Address and attributes should be entered in toml file
        * Tested with TANGO controls on a virtual machine (communication through the virtual switch)
        * PyMoDAQ Version 4.4.7
        * OS : Microsoft 11 Pro 10.0.22631
        * pyTango and tomllib should be installed. To test pyTango install, run the following lines in the CLI
            python
            from tango import DeviceProxy
            tango_host = tango.ApiUtil.get_env_var("TANGO_HOST")
            print(tango_host)
            print(tango.__version__)
        To test communication, run :
            my_device = DeviceProxy(<some known device address, e.g. "SY-SPECTRO_1/Spectrometer/FE1">)
            print(my_device.read_attribute(<some known attribute, e.g. "lambda">).value)
        * The wrapper is in the hardware folder. It uses the tango bus as some sort of virtual hardware.
        This is also where the toml config file is located. It has to be filled for the plugin to work !

    This object inherits all functionalities to communicate with PyMoDAQâ€™s DAQ_Viewer module through inheritance via
    DAQ_Viewer_base. It makes a bridge between the DAQ_Viewer module and the Python wrapper of a particular instrument.
